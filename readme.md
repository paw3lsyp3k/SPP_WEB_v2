Hello there!


This is a website project which I created to learn some stuff. 
My whole process of creating this project includes designing this website and sections in figma and then coding it in VSCode.

I did my best to make it fully responsive on tablets and mobile devices. I also use 2 (for me)very nice things, which are "jump.js" and "ScrollMagic".

I hope you like it and I cannot wait for your feedback.
See you in the next projects!
